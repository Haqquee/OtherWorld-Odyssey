In a small, creaking apartment on the outskirts of an old city, Mira moved in with relief, glad to finally have a place of her own. The walls were yellowed with age, the floorboards groaned underfoot, and every night a chill seemed to creep from the corners. But it was hers, and the price was right.

It was during her second night there that she noticed it. The faintest sound of whispering, barely audible over the groaning of the pipes and the hum of her small refrigerator. She stopped, her heart quickening as she strained to listen. The sound was gone.

She convinced herself it was just nerves. Old buildings were full of noises, she reminded herself. Still, as she lay in bed that night, sleep eluded her. She kept hearing a faint scratching, like the scuttle of tiny claws, directly behind her head where her bed rested against the wall. She turned on the light and searched for any signs of mice or bugs, but the walls were smooth and bare.

The next morning, Mira discovered a crack in the paint along her bedroom wall. It hadn’t been there the day before. She ran her fingers along it, tracing the jagged line that snaked from her headboard down to the floor. For some reason, the touch of that crack made her feel cold.

A few nights later, the whispers returned. This time, they were clearer—urgent, yet muffled, as if spoken through a layer of cloth. They filled her room with faint, incoherent murmurings. She lay stiff in bed, heart pounding. She forced herself to stay silent, too terrified to respond, but the whispers only grew louder.

“I know you’re listening,” the voice hissed, barely above a whisper, but it was there—clear and directed right at her. She could feel the malice in it, something ancient and suffocating.

The next morning, she called her landlord, complaining of noises. He promised to send an inspector to check for pests or leaks, but they found nothing. Mira tried to shake it off, but each night it got worse. The whispers became pleading, then angry, as if something was clawing its way out from within the walls.

One night, when she could take it no more, she stood in front of the crack in the wall with a hammer, determined to end it once and for all. The walls seemed to shiver under her gaze, and she felt a sickening sense of dread, as if the apartment itself were holding its breath.

Taking a deep breath, she swung the hammer at the crack. The drywall crumbled, revealing a small hollow space behind the wall. It was too dark to see anything inside, so she reached in, her fingers brushing against something soft and wet.

She pulled her hand back, heart pounding, and turned on her phone’s flashlight. Shining it into the gap, she froze. A pair of bloodshot eyes stared back at her, set in a pale, grinning face that seemed half-melted, its flesh sagging in unnatural ways.

Before she could scream, a hand shot out, clawed and bony, grabbing her wrist with a grip like iron. The thing pulled itself closer, pressing its face to the opening, lips twisted into a hideous smile.

"Thank you for finding me," it whispered, its voice hollow and eager.

Mira yanked her arm away, slamming the hammer into the creature’s face with every ounce of strength she had. It released her, screeching, as she stumbled backward, scrambling out of the room and down the hallway. She didn’t stop running until she was out on the street, breathless and shaking, barely able to comprehend what had just happened.

Later, after the police arrived, they found her apartment empty. No traces of anyone inside the walls, no signs of damage, no cracks in the paint. Everything was untouched—except for one thing.

In the dust on her bedroom floor, someone had scrawled a single sentence, etched with a fingertip: "I’ll be waiting for you."

Mira left that night, never returning, but sometimes, late at night in her new apartment, she swore she could hear the faintest scratching… coming from behind the walls.
